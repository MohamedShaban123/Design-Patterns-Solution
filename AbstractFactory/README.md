# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## ?? Definition
The **Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.  
It is often described as a **"factory of factories"** because it creates entire product families.

## ?? Intent
- Encapsulate the creation of related objects into a single factory.  
- Ensure that products created by a factory are compatible with each other.  
- Decouple client code from concrete classes by programming to interfaces.  

## ??? Structure
- **Abstract Factory** ? Declares methods for creating abstract products.  
- **Concrete Factories** ? Implement creation methods to produce a family of related products.  
- **Abstract Products** ? Declare interfaces for different kinds of products.  
- **Concrete Products** ? Specific implementations of abstract products, grouped into families.  
- **Client** ? Uses only the interfaces declared by the abstract factory and abstract products.  

## ? Benefits
- Ensures consistency among products in the same family.  
- Promotes loose coupling between client and concrete classes.  
- Makes it easy to introduce new product families without changing client code.  

## ?? Drawbacks
- Can increase complexity because of multiple interfaces and classes.  
- Difficult to add new product types (requires modifying all factories).  

## ?? Use Cases
- Building cross-platform UI libraries (Windows/Mac/Linux widgets).  
- Working with multiple database providers (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL).  
- Designing systems where related objects must be used together.  

## ?? Real-World Examples
- UI toolkits that support multiple operating systems.  
- Database drivers that provide families of related objects (connection, command, reader).  
- Game engines that must create platform-specific objects like sounds, textures, and input handlers.
